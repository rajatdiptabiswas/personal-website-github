When code in a GitHub repository is managed, it will automatically render a webpage with the profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories.

It's all possible using the combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (for building your website), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for hosting your website), and [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (for automatically populating your website with content).
